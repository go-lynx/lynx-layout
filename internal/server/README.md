# Server Directory Documentation

Welcome to this documentation! 🎉🎉🎉 Here, we'll delve into the main purpose and usage of the `server` directory.

## 1. The Service Configuration Center: The Server Directory 🛠

> The `server` directory is the service configuration center of our project. It's a dedicated place for configuring services related to our API interfaces. You can think of it as the backstage 🎭 of our application, where all the service protocol settings and pre-defined configurations for API interfaces take place.

## 2. Customization and Control 🎯

> The `server` directory is also a space of control and customization 🎨. For example, if an interface needs to be available over gRPC for internal microservice use but doesn't require HTTP for external traffic, you can make that happen right here in this directory.

> By providing a dedicated space for service configurations, the `server` directory ensures that our application can be finely tuned to meet specific requirements or preferences. This allows us to maintain a tight control over how our APIs behave and interact with both internal and external entities. 🚀🚀🚀

> We hope this guide helps you navigate the `server` directory more effectively. Happy coding! 💻💻💻
