# Service Directory Documentation

Welcome to this documentation! 🎉🎉🎉 Here, we will delve into the main purpose and usage of the `service` directory.

## 1. The Service Provider: The Service Directory 📡

> The `service` directory is the service provider of our project. It's a place where we declare the specific services that our application offers. You can think of it as the front desk 🎫 of a hotel, where guests (clients) can request specific services.

> Each service provided corresponds one-to-one with the service interfaces generated under the `api` directory's `proto` files. This means our application can offer a wide array of services, each tailored to a specific need.

## 2. Protocol Compatibility and Request Handling 🎯

> The `service` directory is also a protocol chameleon 🦎, capable of adapting to multiple protocols for service calls. In general, it allows service calls via HTTP and gRPC protocols, providing flexibility for various use-cases.

> The logic in the `service` layer mainly involves some parameter validation and request content conversion operations. Specifically, it performs `req -> bo` (request to business object) conversions and `bo -> rep` (business object to response) operations.

> By doing so, the `service` directory ensures that our services are robust, reliable, and adaptable to various client needs. 🚀🚀🚀

> We hope this guide helps you navigate the `service` directory more effectively. Happy coding! 💻💻💻
