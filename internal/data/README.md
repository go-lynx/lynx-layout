# Data Directory Documentation

Welcome to this documentation! 🎉🎉🎉 Here, we will delve into the main purpose and usage of the `data` directory.

## 1. The Data Handler: The Data Directory 🗃️

> The `data` directory is the data handler of our project. It's a place dedicated to processing data, primarily focusing on code logic related to databases, remote calls, and middleware communication. You can think of it as the engine room 🏭 of a ship, where the actual power (data handling) is generated.

> Unlike the `biz` directory, which focuses on business logic, the `data` directory doesn't concern itself with the 'what' (the business logic). Instead, it's all about the 'how' - how to implement the interfaces defined in the `biz` layer.

## 2. Role in Data Source Management and External Communication 🎯

> The `data` directory is also the manager of our data sources. It handles multiple data sources, manages Redis, various caches, and maintains the remote gRPC clients. It's like the switchboard operator 📞 of our project, ensuring all external communications are handled correctly and efficiently.

> By doing so, the `data` directory ensures that our project can communicate effectively with various external services and databases, making our application more robust and versatile. 🚀🚀🚀

> We hope this guide helps you navigate the `data` directory more effectively. Happy coding! 💻💻💻
