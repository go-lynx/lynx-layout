# Biz Directory Documentation

Welcome to this documentation! 🎉🎉🎉 Here, we will delve into the main purpose and usage of the `biz` directory.

## 1. The Heart of Business Logic: The Biz Directory 🏢

> The `biz` directory is the heart of our project, a place dedicated to encapsulating the overall business logic. It is where we craft the flow of our business operations, without getting into the specifics of data manipulation or remote call content.

> In other words, the `biz` directory is like the conductor 🎼 of an orchestra, guiding the overall performance but not playing the instruments itself.

## 2. Recommendation for Implementing Business Logic 🎯

> When implementing your business logic, we highly recommend that the methods you call should be abstract interfaces rather than concrete execution processes.

> Think of it as building with Lego blocks. Each block (method) should serve a clear purpose, but the specifics of how it's made or what's inside it (concrete execution process) doesn't matter as long as it fits into the overall structure (business logic) correctly.

> This way, we can ensure that our business logic is clean, efficient, and easy to maintain. Plus, it makes it easier for everyone on the team to understand and contribute to the project. 🚀🚀🚀

> We hope this guide helps you navigate the `biz` directory more effectively. Happy coding! 💻💻💻
