# BO Directory Documentation

Welcome to this documentation! 🎉🎉🎉 Here, we will delve into the main purpose and usage of the `bo` directory.

## 1. The Conveyor Belt of Data: The BO Directory 🚚

> The `bo` directory is the conveyor belt of our project, a place dedicated to facilitating data flow. It primarily handles the data transfer between the `biz` and `data` layers. It doesn't contain any business logic but focuses on the overall data flow process: `req -> bo -> entity` and `entity -> bo -> rep`.

> Think of the `bo` directory as the postal service 📬 of our project. It doesn't write the letters (business logic), but it makes sure they get from the sender (`biz` layer) to the recipient (`data` layer), and vice versa.

## 2. Role in Data Handling and Reusability 🎯

> The `bo` directory can also encapsulate some common data handling logic, data aggregation logic, and calculation assembly logic. This is like a sorting facility in the postal service, where letters are organized and bundled together for more efficient delivery.

> By doing so, we increase code reusability and make our project more efficient and maintainable. The `bo` directory ensures that our data flows smoothly and accurately between different layers, supporting the overall functionality of our project. 🚀🚀🚀

> We hope this guide helps you navigate the `bo` directory more effectively. Happy coding! 💻💻💻
