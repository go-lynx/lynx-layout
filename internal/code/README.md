# Code Directory Documentation

Welcome to this documentation! 🎉🎉🎉 Here, we will delve into the main purpose and usage of the `code` directory.

## 1. The Keeper of Status Codes: The Code Directory 📚

> The `code` directory is the keeper of all status codes in our application. It's a place where we store various exception codes, error codes, and business status codes. You can think of it as the control tower 🗼 of an airport. While it doesn't fly the planes (execute the business logic), it provides crucial signals and guidance (status codes) that help pilots (developers) navigate the airspace (application).

> By having a centralized place for all status codes, we can quickly locate and troubleshoot issues in our application. This makes our application more maintainable and our debugging process more efficient.

## 2. Role in Troubleshooting and Debugging 🎯

> The `code` directory plays a vital role in troubleshooting and debugging. When an issue arises, the status codes stored in the `code` directory act like a detective's clues 🔍, helping us quickly pinpoint the problem.

> Moreover, by providing a comprehensive list of status codes, the `code` directory helps us understand the various states our application can be in at any given time. This is crucial for maintaining a robust and reliable application. 🚀🚀🚀

> We hope this guide helps you navigate the `code` directory more effectively. Happy coding! 💻💻💻
